## About me
2014 Harvard grad with honors in [Social Studies](https://socialstudies.fas.harvard.edu/), a secondary in Psychology, and senior thesis on US gun ownership (see _Research Details_). Since then I've built models and conducted research as a business strategy consultant at [Endeavour Partners](https://endeavour.partners/about/) for smartphone, wireless, reinsurance, and infrastructure companies.

I look forward to doing mixed-methods research on the drivers of [legal gun acquisition](https://github.com/justinsola/justinsola.github.com/raw/master/files/Approx_US_Firearm_Sales_by_Month_(Jan1999-Aug2017).pdf), flows into illegal gun markets, and how legal and illegal guns influence [health outcomes](https://github.com/justinsola/justinsola.github.com/raw/master/files/US_Firearm_Deaths_by_Type_(1999-2015).pdf). My plan is to excel in statistics, criminology, and sociology coursework to further my research, and also to better understand the role of socioeconomic inequality in gun violence. I want to conduct research that, to paraphrase Peter Bearman, exhibits formal rigor, respects the actors by placing them in the right action frames, and that imputes motives that are adequately.

Outside of study I like building computers, reading science fiction, making beef jerky ([my personal recipe](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14g3BNcLFfN2xKgDRqwK4-0S1jt4SJRSaw_OR_8raQ0g/edit?usp=sharing)), puns, playing drum set (working on some [Tesseract](https://www.tesseractband.co.uk/) songs), making [pretty histograms](https://github.com/justinsola/justinsola.github.com/tree/master/code), and civic volunteering (I'm a Boston organizer at civicseries.org).

## Research details

I want to understand what drives gun acquisition, how gun ownership affects US society, and ways to improve public health outcomes with respect to guns. I began my research on these topics my junior year at Harvard. Two discrepancies drove me to begin research on US gun ownership in my junior year at Harvard:
   
First, I noted a disconnect between how gun owners thought about legitimate force and how social theorists, like Max Weber, argued that a modern state had a “monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force” within its territory. Gun owners seemed to disagree, arguing that their gun ownership both competed with a government monopoly on force and complimented it by ensuring their personal safety.
   
Second, I felt that there wasn't enough sociological research on US gun ownership; most I had found was conducted via survey (Gallup and Pew), or was more concerned with outcome than mechanism and motive, like David Hemenway’s seminal statistical analyses. As Randall Collins said about the study of US gun ownership:
>it is not a sociological explanation of behavior to invoke the reasons given, especially on occasions of public justification and debate....Instead we should ask, 'Why do particular people come to believe in these reasons, or rather, in what circumstances do they invoke them....What is it that possessors of guns do?' –Interaction Ritual Chains (2004)
  
So in my senior thesis I conducted semi-structured interviews with 36 gun owners and police officers from Vermont and Massachusetts. I wanted to understand participants' gun ownership practices, and how participants believed responsibility for welfare and security should be divided between individuals, families, communities, and governments. I then coded participants’ beliefs, and then correlated those beliefs to the types of guns owned, concealed carry behavior, stance on gun controls.
