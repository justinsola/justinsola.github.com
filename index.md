## Recent publications

<a href="https://github.com/justinsola/justinsola.github.com/blob/master/files/CV February 2021.pdf">**Sola, Justin L**.  Accepted (preprint) 2021</a>. Transmitting Desire: An Experiment on a Novel Measure of Gun Desirability in a Pandemic. *Sociological Perspectives â€“ COVID-19 and Society Special Issue*.

## Research orientation

My primary research areas are the measure and drivers of gun desirability, how carceral contact affects inequality (e.g. monetary sanctions), the epistemic status of mixed-methods social research, and how people consume security through training, equipment, group membership, and mindset adoption.

I use both qual and quant methods and employ various research designs, including experimental, survey, and participant observations combined with interview. I want to conduct research that is rigorous, respects actors' frames of action, and that imputes adequate motives and mechanisms of behavior (to paraphrase Peter Bearman).
